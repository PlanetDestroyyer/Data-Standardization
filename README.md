Data standardization, also known as data normalization, is the process of transforming data into a common format to make it consistent and comparable. This is particularly important when dealing with datasets that contain variables with different scales or units. Standardization typically involves rescaling the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, often referred to as z-score normalization.

**Key Steps in Data Standardization:**

1. **Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation:** Compute the mean and standard deviation for each feature or variable in the dataset.

2. **Subtract Mean:** Subtract the mean value of each feature from the corresponding values in the dataset. This centers the data around zero.

3. **Divide by Standard Deviation:** Divide the centered data by the standard deviation of each feature. This scales the data to have a standard deviation of 1.

**Benefits of Data Standardization:**

1. **Facilitates Model Convergence:** Standardized data can help machine learning algorithms converge faster during training, especially for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of input features, such as gradient descent-based algorithms.

2. **Improves Interpretability:** Standardizing data makes it easier to interpret the coefficients or feature importance in models, as all features are on the same scale.

3. **Enhances Comparability:** Standardization enables meaningful comparisons between different features or variables, as they are transformed into a common scale.
